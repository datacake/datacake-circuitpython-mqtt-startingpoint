Circuit Python Script for ESP32 or other boards using MQTT and various sensors, sending data to Datacake IoT Platform

## Information

This script shows a very simple way of connecting your ESP32 based boards to Datacake using MQTT and the internal Datacake MQTT broker.

## Documentation

### MQTT Integration

This example is using the internal Datacake MQTT Broker. Read more on how to connect devices, services or others via MQTT [on our documentation](https://docs.datacake.de/api/internal-mqtt).

#### Third Party MQTT

If you wish to use your very own (a third-party) MQTT Broker to Datacake, or if you have fixed topic structure, or wish to send JSON instead of one topic per database field, check out our [Third-Party MQTT Integration](https://docs.datacake.de/integrations/mqtt).
